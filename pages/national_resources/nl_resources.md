## Introduction 
This is an overview of research data management resources in the Netherlands, relevant for researchers in the Netherlands and to their collaborators. 

The [ELIXIR Netherlands website](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/netherlands) provides information on the organisation of and resources for ELIXIR Netherlands partners. The Dutch ELIXIR Node is hosted by the [Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences (DTL)](https://www.dtls.nl), which is a public-private partnership of more than 50 life science institutions, and focuses on data stewardship capacity building, services and infrastructure to support FAIR implementation for the Dutch life science research. 

## Funders
National funders [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-data-management) and [ZonMw](https://www.zonmw.nl/en/research-and-results/fair-data-and-data-management) consider responsible research data management an essential component of good research practice. They promote FAIR data stewardship - among others via mandatory data management plans, the requirement to deposit and share (meta)data, and facilitating researchers in creating FAIR data (with help of the [GO FAIR Foundation](https://www.gofairfoundation.org/m4m/), Health-RI and DTL). 
For more information on the requirements for FAIR data stewardship, consult the fundersâ€™ webpages and their particular policies about data management and Open Science.

## National initiatives
Together with [Health-RI](https://www.health-ri.nl), DTL will have a leading role in the national roadmap for the [Thematic Digital Competence Center (TDCC)](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/setup-thematic-digital-competence-centers) for Life Science & Health (LSH), funded by NWO. The TDCC LSH network will formally be established this spring (2022), and will contribute to strengthening and harmonising the digital practises among stakeholders in the broad Dutch research domains of life sciences and biomedical/health sciences.

Moreover, DTL also coordinates the National Programme Open Science (NPOS) [FAIR Data Programme Line](https://www.openscience.nl/en/fair-data-programme-line).

The following national services provide useful information and support:
* [The National Coordination Point Research Data Management](https://www.lcrdm.nl/en) (LCRDM)
* [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en), the collaborative organisation for IT in Dutch education and research
* [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/), the Dutch national centre of expertise and repository for research data
* [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/), the Dutch national data repository for science, engineering and design 
* [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) (NleSC), building and applying software to enhance the use of computing and digital technologies in academic research
* [Research Data Netherlands](https://researchdata.nl/en/) (RDNL), collaboration of SURF, 4TU.ResearchData, DANS and DTL to contribute to strengthening the National Programme Open Science, and helping create a FAIR research ecosystem across science fields, and its [Essentials 4 Data Support](https://datasupport.researchdata.nl/en/) Training 
* The [DTL Data Stewards Interest Group](https://www.dtls.nl/about/community/interest-groups/data-stewards-interest-group/) (DSIG), the Dutch (and beyond) community hub for data stewardship that enables informal and inclusive knowledge and experience exchange
* [NL-RSE](https://nl-rse.org/), the Dutch community of people writing and contributing to research software
* The Dutch [Open Science Communities](https://www.openscience.nl/en/open-science-communities) (OSC), independent, bottom up local communities comprising members of various scientific disciplines and career stages, who want to learn more about Open Science
* [RDA-NL](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-netherlands), the Dutch Research Data Alliance Node 

## Assistance
Researchers seeking practical assistance best check [RDM in the Netherlands](https://www.lcrdm.nl/en/rdm-in-the-netherlands), which provides information on the various local universitiesâ€™ and university medical centers support desks.
